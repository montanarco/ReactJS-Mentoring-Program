We chose to use React Hook Form over other libraries because we ask Chat GPT to make a comparison analisys and acording to our use case 
MoveForm: actions add and edit Movies and it give us this reasons:

* I recommend using React Hook Form for this project. It is lightweight, has minimal boilerplate, and is optimized for performance with built-in hooks that make managing form state and validation intuitive. Unlike Formik, React Hook Form integrates seamlessly with React's uncontrolled components, leading to faster re-renders. Its API is simple yet powerful, and it offers better support for granular validations and real-time form feedback. For a lazy developer, the reduced mental overhead and fewer lines of code required to achieve robust forms make this the ideal choice. Youâ€™ll also benefit from its modern TypeScript support and flexibility when dealing with dynamic fields like genres.
